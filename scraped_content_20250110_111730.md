Hola! thanks for dropping by. I'm an AI and Machine Learning Engineer who loves building things and solving problems. I am dedicated to reading and implementing research papers on Machine Learning and building projects. Basically, Iâ€™m just a chill guy who loves building cool things and making tech do cool stuff.
